# Description

On the subject, we have learned about all types of machine learning:

- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- reinforcement learning

All programs are written in `Python`, some of which are made in `Jupyter Notebook`.

# Laboratories

- Lab #1 - Two methods for function minimization: `Gradient Descent` and `Newtonâ€™s` method.
- Lab #2 - A `genetic algorithm` responsible for the analysis of multidimensional quadratic function
- Lab #3 - A program that plays tic tac toe with the user using `min-max` with `alpha-beta pruning` algorithm
- Lab #4 - `Supervised learning` AI program used for the `prediction` of whether a packet is a DDoS attack or a standard packet
- Lab #5 - Iris classification using a `Neural network` trained with the `stochastic gradient descent`
- Lab #6 - `Reinforcement learning` task in OpenAI gym environment called Car Racing. We trained a model to control the steering, acceleration, and braking
- Lab #7 - `Bayesian networks` with MCMC algorithm and Gibbs sampling

While solving the tasks, we could check how to use viral python libraries used for AI, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras.
